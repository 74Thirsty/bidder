## Features

- Frontend interface for starting and viewing auctions  
- Backend server to manage bids, select winner, and return results  
- Real‑time or near real‑time interaction between frontend and backend  
- Configurable number of bidders / bidder endpoints  
- Fault tolerance: non‑responsive bidders are timed out  
- Clean modular structure separating UI and server logic  

---

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **frontend**: A web UI (likely built with HTML/CSS/JS, possibly using a bundler)  
- **backend**: A server application (likely in Python + JavaScript, or Node.js + server logic)  

The frontend sends auction requests (with item IDs and parameters) to the backend. The backend then forwards bid requests to multiple configured bidder services (via HTTP), collects responses, determines the highest bid, and returns the winning content (with price substitution).

Timeouts and error handling ensure that slow or unreachable bidders don’t break the auction.
